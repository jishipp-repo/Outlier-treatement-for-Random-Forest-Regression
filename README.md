# Outlier-treatement-for-Random-Forest-Regression
Random Forest is an ensemble method which uses the average of all the individual tree's (weak learners) prediction value. In most cases there would be some tree's which are producing poor results (worst learners). The method described below can be used to remove those outliers from the results thus a better prediction value can be obtained.
